# Hackathon on May 13!

Join public Trustbit Hacakthon on May 13th!

Participants write small programs that control trucks. We unleash them into a simulation. Leaderboards show the winner. Results are shared publicly. Best scores are awarded with prizes.

You can take part in Vienna or remotely. 

Simulation runtime will steer the competition towards collaboration, efficiency and sustainability. Inside it we model the passing of time, a few linked supply chains, logistic bottlenecks and CO2 emissions. 

Participants can also register as a team. They get to program a whole truck fleet, then.

## Reason

Continuous learning is one of the essential things that make up the *ethos of Trustbit*. As we gain new experience from our work, we want to capture the lessons learned and spread them within the company. This includes Domain-Driven Design practices as well as software engineering ideas from the specific domains. To help with that, we are doing short series of exercises within the different domains.

While doing that we will keep exercises public and transparent. Perhaps, somebody else would find them helpful or entertaining.

# From Softwarepark to Trustbit

The company used to be called Softwarepark, but was rebranded to Trustbit recently. [Here is the story](https://trustbit.tech/from-softwarepark-to-trustbit).
